      {"Step 1":"Put the croissant and cognac in a blender or food processor and whizz until smooth. Transfer to a freezable container, cover and freeze for at least 2 hours. Strain through a very fine sieve (or for an even clearer finish, through coffee filter paper) and reserve."},{"Step 2":"Put the Nutella, sugar and 25ml water in a small saucepan and gently warm until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool."},

Put a spoon over the top of the coffee and gently pour double cream onto it (it should float on the surface of the coffee). Garnish with toasted coconut flakes."}

    "description":"This homemade rhubarb cordial highlights both the sweet and vegetal flavours of rhubarb. It's a nice light, bright and spritzy drink that should go well with just about everything as it's not too sweet. Follow our serving suggestion to make a simple rhubarb cocktail.",
    "ingredients":[
    "500g rhubarb, cut into 1cm slices, chopped","200g granulated sugar","300ml non-alcoholic spirit (Roberta uses Feragaia) or gin to serve (optional)","Soda water to serve","Rhubarb ribbons to serve (optional)"],
    "method":[
        {"Step 1":"Put 300g of the rhubarb in a container and freeze. Put the remaining rhubarb in a jar or container with the sugar and 100ml water, giving it a good stir, then cover and put in the fridge for 2-3 days - it's a long time to wait, but this will allow the sugar to dissolve and the rhubarb's colour and flavour to infuse into the liquid."},
        {"Step 2":"After 2-3 days, put the frozen rhubarb in a metal bowl. Cover tightly with foil, then set it over a pan of simmering water. Leave the rhubarb to defrost and then cook like this for 2 hours - the freezing process breaks down the cells in the rhubarb which then allows the juice to leach out of it once heated."},
        {"Step 3":"Strain the juice from the frozen and cooked rhubarb into a sterilised jar or bottle, then strain the syrupy liquid from the other rhubarb into it, mixing the two liquids together. Keep in the fridge for up to a week. To serve, mix 30ml of the rhubarb cordial with 30ml of non-alcoholic spirit or gin, then top with soda water. Garnish with a ribbon of rhubarb (if you like)."}
